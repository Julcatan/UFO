# UFO

## Overview of Project:
 --
 - The purpose of the analysis is to offer a webpage that enables the website user to filter the large data set of UFO sightings by 
  - date
  - city
  - state
  - country
  & shape

## Resources
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript
 
## Results: 
 --
The website can be used to filter the data and give information in a concise way. A user could for instance filter the data by city. 
In order to to that the user needs to add a date in the format shown in the date filter.



The data table on the right will then change to show only the filtered data.

The other filters work in a similar fashion.


##Summary: 
 --
A draw back is that the dates can not be filtered by a range. Only filtering by a specific day is possible.
Adding a date filter by range could be included in further developments. Another improvement could be to add a filter based on counties.
The input is case sensitive
