# UFO

## Overview of Project:
 
 - The purpose of the analysis is to offer a webpage that enables the website user to filter the large data set of UFO sightings by 
  - date
  - city
  - state
  - country
  - shape

## Resources
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript
 
## Results: 
 
The website can be used to filter the data and give information in a concise way. 
The filter is located on the left hand side and includes an example for each entry to help the user with the input format.
The user can enter just one or several criteria.

The table on the right will then change to show only the data that meets the entered criteria.

Here is an example of a filtered search result:

##Summary: 
 
A draw back is that the dates can not be filtered by a date range. Only filtering by a specific day is possible.
Adding a date filter by range could be included in further developments. Another improvement could be to add a filter based on counties.
It feels awkward that there is no actual submit button to "submit" the filtered input.
The input is not adjusting to upper or lower case. This means the user needs to know exactly how the e.g. the city was spelled in the original dataset in order to find it.
Also there is no option to choose a shape. How would a user know what options there are without knowing the actual data. Adding a feature to ignore the case of letters and/or
a dropdown menu could be included in an additional development.
